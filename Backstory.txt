Once upon a time a few hundred years ago…..

The Human World and the Candy World were once one world. 

One day, the Candy Lord decided he wanted power. 
He kidnapped a bunch of candy people to become his slaves and protectors.
He decided to make a candy storm that destroyed half of the world. 
The humans came to a decision that ALL candy people were to be banished to their own world.
When this happened, the Candy Lord already had so much power that he was able to become the Dictator of Candy World.

The Candy People hate the Candy Lord, but they can’t overthrow him on their own. 
This is your job! 
But before you can do that, you must defeat his protectors. 
There are 10 of them, each one harder than the one before.

There is a portal that opens once a year between the worlds. 
It is only open for 12 hours. 
You have 12 hours to defeat the Candy Lord or else you are stuck in the Candy World as a slave for the Candy Lord.
