Rolling the Dice:
After any upgrades, players roll a 6-sided dice and move that many spaces forward.
If a player rolls a number that exceeds the remaining spaces to the next portal (e.g., rolling a 5 while on space 8), they cannot move past the portal.
Entering Portals:
To enter the portal at the end of a row, players must defeat a candy monster.
Each row features a unique candy monster (e.g., Licorice Whip, Candy Corn Golem, Jelly Bean Beast, etc.).
Candy Monsters:
Each candy monster has specific stats for attack, defense, and health. 
If all of the players stats are higher than the candy monster, they can beat it.
A random number will be generatored. If it's below their attack, they attack the monster.
If not, the monster attacks them.
